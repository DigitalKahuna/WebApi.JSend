[![NuGet Pre Release](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/WebApi.JSend.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebApi.JSend)

Simple implementation of JSON responses in JSend format for ASP.NET Web API.

[More information](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend) about the JSend specification.

### Installing WebApi.JSend

You should install [WebApi.JSend with NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebApi.JSend):

```
Install-Package WebApi.JSend
```

This command from Package Manager Console will download and install WebApi.JSend and all required dependencies.

### Using WebApi.JSend

The projects ships with `JSendApiResponseActionFilter` which wraps your response into a JSend JSON. This is all that's necessary to configure basic JSend responses:

```csharp
var config = new HttpConfiguration();

config.Filters.Add(new JSendApiResponseActionFilter());
```
    
If you'd like to convert authorization errors to JSend format, add `JSendAuthorizationAttribute` either globally as shown below or on each controller/action like you would with regular `AuthorizationAttribute`.    
    
```csharp
config.Filters.Add(new JSendAuthorizationAttribute());
```

Finally, I found it handy to be able to throw exceptions from the service layer and have them convert to a JSend failure response. If you'd like this functionality simply add `ApiExceptionToJSendApiResponseActionFilter` to your filters.
    
```csharp
config.Filters.Add(new ApiExceptionToJSendApiResponseActionFilter());
```

You can then create your custom exception types as shown below:

```csharp
public class NotFoundException : ApiException
{
    public NotFoundException(string message) : base(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, message)
    { }
}
```
